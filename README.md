# Crew Equipment Library
Adds a tab that can hold items you can give to your crew.

Don't patch this unless you're also patching something that uses it, otherwise it will just waste clock cycles and add a useless tab.

### Requirements:
[Lightweight Lua](https://github.com/neopryne/lightweight-lua) 0.15.1+
